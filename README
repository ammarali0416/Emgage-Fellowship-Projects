These scripts were used to reconcile all of the donations Emgage recieved every month. The database software Emgage used, called EveryAction, had the ability to lable individual
donations with a source code, and allowed backend users to search for donations by filtering for source codes. These source codes were meant to track which Emgage chapters each 
donation went to. Source codes were automatically applied to donations when a donor contributed through one of Emagage's online contribution forms.

More than one source code would be used for a chapter state, and source codes also were used for multiple states. These scripts would input an excel file of all the donations for 
a given month, seperate all the contacts by there respective states, and then calculate how much money each chapter and the National chapter brought in through board member donations,
individual contributors, and from grant giving organizations.
