This project consited of cleaning an excel file for my direct superior. The excel file consisted of multiple columns regarding donor data, including their name, number of donations,
the total amount they donated, as well as other contact information. These donors did not already exist in Emgage's database, and donated to Emgage right at its founding.
I read in the data from an excel file, deleted all of the irrelevant columns and rows, and created and new file for export with the contacts name, and also created a new columns
that had the average donation amount for each contact.
